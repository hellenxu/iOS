<p>
   Failure doesn't mean you are a failure, </br>
　　It does mean you haven't succeeded yet. </br>
　　Failure doesn't mean you have accomplished nothing，</br>
　　It does mean you have learned something. </br>
　　Failure doesn't mean you have been a fool，</br>
　　It does mean you had a lot of faith. </br>
　　Failure doesn't mean you've been disgraced，</br>
　　It does mean you were willing to try. </br>
　　Failure doesn't mean you don't have it，</br>
　　It does mean you have to do something in a different way. </br>
　　Failure doesn't mean you are inferior，</br>
　　It does mean you are not perfect. </br>
　　Failure doesn't mean you've wasted your life，</br>
　　It does mean you have a reason to start afresh. </br>
　　Failure doesn't mean you should give up，</br>
　　It does mean you must try harder. </br>
　　Failure doesn't mean you'll never make it，</br>
　　It does mean it will take a little longer. </br>
　　Failure doesn't mean God has abandoned you，</br>
　　It does mean God has a better idea.</p>
