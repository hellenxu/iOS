iOS application daily practice in swift.

#### Known issues:
1. cannot show photo reviews.

error log:

> 2019-04-30 21:40:22.204089-0400 EatEat[69983:2445476] [error] warning: Multiple NSEntityDescriptions claim the NSManagedObject subclass 'RestaurantPhoto' so +entity is unable to disambiguate. CoreData: warning: Multiple NSEntityDescriptions claim the NSManagedObject subclass 'RestaurantPhoto' so +entity is unable to disambiguate.

2. Done button doesn't show on custom notification setting page.


3. Warning - ambiguous constraints

> [Warning] Warning once only: Detected a case where constraints ambiguously suggest a height of zero for a tableview cell's content view. We're considering the collapse unintentional and using standard height instead.

Fixed:
```swift 
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        tableView.delegate = self
        tableView.dataSource = self
        tableView.rowHeight = 60
        requestContactPermission()
    }
```
why use interface builder to set cell height doesn't work???
